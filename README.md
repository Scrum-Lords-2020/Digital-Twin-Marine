## Running the Project

**First make sure to run `npm i` from the root folder so you have the package that lets you run both apps at the same time.**

To run front and backend at the same time, in the root folder run:

### `npm run dev` 

To run just the frontend, in the root folder run:

### `npm run client`

And to run just the backend, from the root folder run:

### `npm run server`
